Best practice is to create a separate file for variables called ",r.createElement(n.code,null,"terraform.tfvars")," which is automatically scanned by terraform, and define variables like this: ",r.createElement(n.code,null,'my_variable = "hello"')," in each line. If the variables are defined in a different file, we can tell terraform to look for it using ",r.createElement(n.code,null,"--var-file")," parameter. Variable types can vary from string, number, array, object, tuples and so on."),"\n",r.createElement(n.h2,null,"Credits & Attributions"),"\n",r.createElement(n.ul,null,"\n",r.createElement(n.li,null,r.createElement(n.a,{href:"https://www.terraform.io/docs"},"Official Terraform Documentation")),"\n",r.createElement(n.li,null,r.createElement(n.a,{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLB_c_ayRMo"},"Terraform Tutorial")),"\n"))}var l=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:n}=Object.assign({},(0,a.RP)(),e.components);return n?r.createElement(n,e,r.createElement(o,e)):o(e)},i=t(1173);function s(e){return r.createElement(i.A,e,r.createElement(l,e))}i.A},1173:function(e,n,t){t.d(n,{p:function(){return p},A:function(){return f}});var r=t(454),a=t(6540),o=t(557),l=t(6835),i=t(3328),s=t(7715),c=t(7169);var u=e=>{let{post:n}=e;return null};const d=["16px","8px","4px"].map(e=>"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px "+e+" "+e+" 0px");var m=e=>{let{data:{post:n},children:t}=e;return(0,o.Y)(i.A,null,(0,o.Y)(l.DZ,{as:"h1",variant:"styles.h1"},n.title),(0,o.Y)("p",{sx:{color:"secondary",mt:3,a:{color:"secondary"},fontSize:[1,1,2]}},(0,o.Y)("time",null,n.date),n.tags&&(0,o.Y)(a.Fragment,null," — ",(0,o.Y)(s.A,{tags:n.tags})),n.timeToRead&&" — ",n.timeToRead&&(0,o.Y)("span",null,n.timeToRead," min read")),(0,o.Y)("section",{sx:{my:5,".gatsby-resp-image-wrapper":{my:[4,4,5],borderRadius:"4px",boxShadow:d.join(", "),".gatsby-resp-image-image":{borderRadius:"4px"}},variant:"layout.content"}},t),(0,o.Y)(u,{post:n}))};const p=e=>{var n,t,r;let{data:{post:a}}=e;return(0,o.Y)(c.A,{title:a.title,description:a.description?a.description:a.excerpt,image:a.banner?null===(n=a.banner)||void 0===n||null===(t=n.childImageSharp)||void 0===t||null===(r=t.resize)||void 0===r?void 0:r.src:void 0,pathname:a.slug,canonicalUrl:a.canonicalUrl})};function f(e){let n=Object.assign({},((0,r.A)(e),e));return a.createElement(m,n)}},7715:function(e,n,t){var r=t(557),a=t(6540),o=t(4794),l=t(3601),i=t(2174);n.A=e=>{let{tags:n}=e;const{tagsPath:t,basePath:s}=(0,l.A)();return(0,r.Y)(a.Fragment,null,n.map((e,n)=>(0,r.Y)(a.Fragment,{key:e.slug},!!n&&", ",(0,r.Y)(o.Link,{sx:e=>{var n;return Object.assign({},null===(n=e.styles)||void 0===n?void 0:n.a)},to:(0,i.A)("/"+s+"/"+t+"/"+e.slug)},e.name))))}}}]);
