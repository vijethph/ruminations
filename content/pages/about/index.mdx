Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vijeth.

I am a student at University College Dublin, pursuing an MSc in Computer Science. Previously, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Cimpress. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science from RNS Institute of Technology.

My interests are in web development, solving programming problems and learning about new technologies.

When I am not coding, I love playing instrumental music with my keyboard, drawing, playing badminton and solving crossword puzzles.
