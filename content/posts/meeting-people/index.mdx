When you were in school, you were constantly surrounded by people the same age, and there was likely always some kind of social event going on. When you leave school, this is no longer the case. Now, it is on you to find and create those social opportunities yourself. There are many options to meet new people after school, but you have to be willing to embrace them.

## Have A Good Mindset

In general, try to appear friendly and conversational. Be willing to make the first move and strike up a conversation. Compliment someone. Make small talk. Be genuine and curious. Ask them about their family or work. Ask them where they're from. Laugh at their jokes. Listen to people when they talk about themselves. Ask for their contact information. Be vulnerable and open up yourself. You may feel uncomfortable or awkward doing this at first. That's okay. Fake it 'til you make it. You never know where you could meet someone great - you could find your next friend at the grocery or home improvement store, or at a mutual friend's wedding.

Challenge yourself to get out of your comfort zone and try something new. Don't be afraid to do something on your own. Say yes. Be open to new experiences after work or on weekends. You will not meet people if you're not putting in the effort to find those friends in the first place. Make sure you're getting out of the house!

While you want to make friends, you should also be interested in trying something new (or continuing a hobby you enjoy) and having fun. You may also want to consider picking up an old hobby that you lost interest in or didn't have the time for during school (a popular example would be recreational reading). Enjoying yourself should be the primary goal. You don't want to be truly uninterested in what you're doing because that disinterest may not help you form bonds or continue an activity. Start slow and small with invitations to potential new friends. Make it clear that you're interested in hanging out, but don't overwhelm them.

You also don't want to force relationships that are not occurring naturally. You may not click with every person or every group that you meet. That's okay. Don't be discouraged or afraid of rejection. Keep on trying and putting yourself out there. Be who you are. You will find friends for you. There are many people out there. It may just take some time and patience, such as going to a few different events or groups first. Remember relationships take time to develop, as well as effort.

Be open to having friends that may be outside of your immediate age group. Once out of school, age doesn't matter as much. You may find that you make friends with people who are much older or younger than you. If you live in a small town, you may also want to consider looking for friends outside of your immediate area.

## Do Some Self-Reflection

If you've been struggling to make friends, it might be a good idea to engage in some self-reflecting. What's working, and what's not? What are you doing to make friends? How do you feel about the people you're meeting? How do you feel when you're around them?

Think about yourself - your lifestyle and your attitude. Are you going into this with the right mindset? Are you putting yourself in situations where you're meeting the right people for you? Do you truly want to make friends - and is that desire reflecting in the quality of interactions you're having?

If making friends is difficult for you, you may be feeling lonely or depressed. Or, you may already be struggling with some form of depression or anxiety. That's okay. Just make sure you're not pushing people away, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Make sure you're not painting other people as the problem, or dismissing them as potential friends too quickly. If making friends is what you really want, you need to give others a chance.

If you're struggling with your mental health, it might be helpful to work on yourself, such as going to therapy, building yourself up, devoting more time to hobbies and interests, and strengthening your overall confidence. If you have mental health issues, you may find yourself in a cycle that needs to break before you can make progress with yourself and your relationships. For example, if you are prone to judging yourself too harshly, you may be judging others too harshly too, possibly without realizing it. Please seek help if you're feeling like this.

Remember you're not alone. A lot of people feel that relationships after graduating are a huge struggle. Now, here are some ways you can meet people after school.

## Ways to Meet People

1. Join meetup groups (consider looking both inside and outside of Meetup.com), clubs, events, or gatherings in your area. Hobby-oriented groups are a great way to meet new people with common interests. If you're low on money, consider looking online for deals or discounts for local events and classes (such as checking out Groupon). If a group you're interested in doesn't exist, consider taking matters into your own hands and organizing a new event. Others may be interested as well. As hard as it may be to put yourself out there, show up early and talk to people while you're there. Improv classes, D&D gatherings, gaming tournaments, trivia nights, political party clubs, a local music scene, cooking classes, art shows, Toastmasters clubs, museums, film societies, lectures by guest speakers, tours, book clubs, workshops, breweries, festivals, concerts, etc. are all options. Once you find what you like, commit to it and show up consistently.
2. Talk to your co-workers. Go to lunches, happy hours, networking events, and conferences. Invite your co-workers out to do something after work or on weekends. If they say yes, follow through with your request and actively make plans.
3. Join a recreational sports league, a gym, or otherwise take part in some kind of social workout in your spare time. Taking a fitness class at the gym, playing a sport at a park or community center, or going dancing can all offer opportunities to meet new people, and you will keep your mind and body fit too. Consider disc golf, CrossFit, kickball, martial arts, hiking, bowling, running, biking, softball, etc.
4. Volunteer. Find a company or cause you're passionate about. You will likely meet people who are also interested in or passionate about the same cause.
5. Become a regular at a local bar, coffee shop, or library, preferably a small one. Find the place that's right for you and don't be afraid to go alone. Check out any events that might be posted at these places. You can meet and get to know the people there over time.
6. Get to know friends of friends. Your existing friend group can be a great starting point. If you already have a friend, relative, co-worker, or romantic partner in your area, see if they can introduce you to their friend group. This way you can expand your own social circle. Ask your friends if they know anyone you should meet. Invite them to your next get-together. Plan a cookout or potluck and encourage your friends to bring their friends and romantic partners.
7. If you have a dog, go to a dog park to walk your dog. Start conversations with other dog walkers. Alternatively, if you have children, you can make friends with the parents of your children's friends. Organize a play date for your children and invite the parents to stay as well.
8. If you're religious, meet people through your place of worship. Your local church, temple, mosque, etc. may offer religious study groups or other activities for the younger crowd, in addition to regular service.
9. Find people online. Dating apps, friendship apps (Bumble BFF; Hey! VINA for women), Facebook groups, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, r/r4r, your local subreddit, alumni organization, etc. are all options. Establishing a virtual connection first can help. Make a post asking people to hang out. Search hashtags that relate to your interests or local area. Private message someone you'd like to get to know more and be friends with. Consider getting in touch with anyone you went to school with who may be nearby. You may find that acquaintance you didn't know too well in school could now be interested in meeting up.
10. Talk to your neighbors. You may find there are people right on your street or building who you can talk to and connect with. Go over to welcome a new neighbor to the neighborhood or plan a small neighborhood party. If you live with roommates, roommates also have the potential to become good friends.
11. Travel. Consider staying in hostels, couch surfing (for more information, check out couchsurfing.com - you could also consider becoming a host and opening your home to travellers in your area, so you can meet different people without travelling yourself), and participating in group tours and other events. Or, travel locally. Go on a trip or retreat. Check out community centers, yoga studios, and churches and see if they're hosting an out-of-town event anytime soon. If you travel a lot or occasionally for work, you could always try to strike up conversations with people on the bus, train, subway, plane, or other public transport. Your conversations might not continue past your travels, but you never know who you could meet or how much you could end up connecting.
12. Keep in touch (or reconnect) with friends from school. Even in instances where you're not close physically, you can still keep in contact through texting, phone calls, communicating through social media or other online platforms, planning the occasional trip to see old friends, etc. Life gets busy, especially as people progress in their careers, get into serious romantic relationships, get married, and have children, but try not to forget your friends. Make time for them. Show up for the people you care about. Reciprocate their feelings and actions when you can. Prioritize them. Know all relationships require work.

## Meeting People During COVID-19

The global pandemic has made it difficult for many of us to make or maintain new friendships and relationships. While travel and large social gatherings may not be happening any time soon, there may still be ways for you to meet new people. Look into outdoor activities or events where people are committed to social-distancing and being safe. Consider taking a socially-distanced walk or bike ride with a neighbor or relative. If you're struggling with meeting new people during this time, consider devoting more time to building and maintaining relationships through online methods, such as setting up frequent Zoom calls with those you care about. Continuing to talk to people through this time is so important. If you or someone in your household is immunocompromised, look into any virtual gatherings that people may be organizing.

Remember that as we age and go through different life stages, our relationships and friendships evolve as well. People may come and go, but know you always have the opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. We hope you've found this guide helpful as a starting point to make friends as you go through this new stage of your life. While we have provided all these options, remember you're the one who has to get out there and give them a try. Not everything on this list may apply to you, but this broad overview can help you think more about all the possible ways you can make friends, including ways you haven't thought about before.

You also have to be sure to grow and maintain these relationships. You're not going to become best friends with someone after a single meeting or class. Close proximity and repeated interactions will help, and always make sure you are following up and checking in with people. Don't forget about them. Reach out.

**Good luck!**
