Procrastination is not a time management problem. It is an emotion regulation problem - we delay activities which might make us feel not-so-good today and in the near future. Berking's emotional regulation technique is a scientifically verified counter measure.

Behind procrastination, there is negative affect (thoughts, feelings, moods) about a particular task or the outcome of that task.

Sometimes it is related to a fear of failure, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, feelings of incompetence, etc. These hidden anxieties paint the task in negativity and we end up delaying the task. We participate in aversive tasks which make us feel better in the short term to cope with the negative mood induced by the task.

### **The proposed solution is emotional regulation.**

- Choose the task you procrastinate.
- Bring aversive and negative emotions & thoughts associated with the task into awareness.
- Instruct yourself to tolerate those negative emotions such as boredom, fear of failure, fear of judgment, feelings of incompetence, etc.
- Address those emotions by regulating your emotions in a structured manner. Begin with allowing those emotions to exist. Do not suppress them. Then tell yourself that you are strong, tough, and resilient. Finally, ascribe more emotional meaning to the task and emotionally commit to that task.
