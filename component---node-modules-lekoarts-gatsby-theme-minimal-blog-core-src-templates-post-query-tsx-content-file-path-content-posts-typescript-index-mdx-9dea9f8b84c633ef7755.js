When multiple decorators apply to a single declaration, their evaluation is similar to function composition in mathematics. Example:"),"\n",a.createElement(t.pre,null,a.createElement(t.code,{className:"language-ts"},"@classDecorator\nclass Boat {\n  @testDecorator\n  color: string = 'red';\n\n  @testDecorator\n  get formattedColor(): string {\n    return `This boats color is ${this.color}`;\n  }\n\n  @logError('Something bad!')\n  pilot(\n    @parameterDecorator speed: string,\n    @parameterDecorator generateWake: boolean\n  ): void {\n    if (speed === 'fast') {\n      console.log('swish');\n    } else {\n      console.log('nothing');\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// this is a class decorator which is applied to the class itself\n// the only argument to this, is the constructor of that class \nfunction classDecorator(constructor: typeof Boat) {\n  console.log(constructor);\n}\n\n// this is a parameter decorator, where the third argument is the actual index of the argument this decorator is being applied to\nfunction parameterDecorator(target: any, key: string, index: number) {\n  console.log(key, index);\n}\n\n// here the 1st argument is prototype of Boat class, i.e., an object with all the functions defined in class Boat\n// and the 2nd argument is the key/name of the thing to which the decorator is applied\nfunction testDecorator(target: any, key: string) {\n  console.log(key);\n}\n\n// this is a decorator factory\nfunction logError(errorMessage: string) {\n  // PropertyDescriptor type is globally available in TypeScript\n  return function(target: any, key: string, desc: PropertyDescriptor): void {\n    // target[key] = () => {}   !!!
